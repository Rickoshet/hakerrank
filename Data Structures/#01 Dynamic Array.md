## Dynamic Array

### Problem
  * Create a list, *seqList*, of *N* empty sequences, where each sequence is indexed from 0 to *N* - 1. 
The elements within each of the *N* sequences also use 0-indexing.
  * Create an integer, *lastAnswer*, and initialize it to 0.
  * The 2 types of queries that can be performed on your list of sequences *(seqList)* are described below:
  
  I. Query: 1 x y
  
    1. Find the sequnce, seq, at index ((x ⊕ lastAnswer) % N) in seqList.
    2. Append integer y to sequence seq.
        
  II. Query 2 x y
  
    1. Find the sequnce, seq, at index ((x ⊕ lastAnswer) % N) in seqList.
    2. Find the value of element y % size in seq(where size is the size of seq) and assign it to lastAnswer.
    3. Print the new value of lastAnswer on a new line. 
#### Task
Given *N*, *Q*, and *Q* queries, execute each query.                                                                                  
**Note:** ⊕ is the bitwise XOR operation, which corresponds to the ^ operator in most languages. 
Learn more about it on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or 'Exclusive or
').
#### Input Format
The first line contains two space-separated integers, *N* (the number of sequences) and *Q* (the number of queries), respectively. 
Each of the *Q* subsequent lines contains a query in the format defined above.
#### Constraints
  * 1 ≤ *N, Q* ≤ 10^5
  * 0 ≤ *x* ≤ 10^9
  * 0 ≤ *y* ≤ 10^9
  * It's guaranteed that query type 2 will never query an empty sequence or index.
#### Output Format
For each type 2 query, print the updated value of *lastAnswer* on a new line.
#### Sample Input 
```json
2 5
1 0 5
1 1 7
1 0 3
2 1 0
2 1 1
```
#### Sample Output

### Solution
```py
def dynamicArray(n, queries):
    lastNumber = 0
    seqList=[];
    for i in range(n):
        seqList.append([])
    res = [];
    for k, x, y in queries:
        index = (x^lastNumber)%n
        if k==1:
            seqList[index].append(y)
        else:
            size = len(seqList[index])
            lastNumber = seqList[index][y%size]
            res.append(lastNumber)
    return res

n, q = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
queries = []
for i in range(q):
    queries.append(list(map(int, input().rstrip().split())))

print('\n'.join(map(str, dynamicArray(n, queries))))
print('\n')
```
